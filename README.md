# antike-bot-discord
Anti-Nuke Bot is a lightning-fast Discord bot designed to protect servers from nuke-style attacks. It actively monitors and reacts to critical events such as channel or role creation/deletion, bans, member activity, and more — ensuring quick and effective mitigation of malicious actions.

Key Features:

* Instant Event Response: Reacts instantly to suspicious actions like channel/role creation or deletion, member bans or joins, and permission changes, allowing immediate countermeasures against threats.

* Groups & Categories: Supports group and category management to organize users and streamline role-based protection and administration.

* Whitelist System: Built-in whitelist functionality allows trusted users or roles to bypass anti-nuke actions, reducing the chance of false positives.

* Anti-Crash Mechanisms: Resilient error-handling and performance optimization ensure stable bot operation, even during high-stress situations or mass actions.

Modular by design, the bot is split into individual event handlers — each responsible for a specific type of server activity. This makes the bot highly scalable and easy to customize based on the needs of your server. Perfect for communities that demand fast, reliable, and automated protection against raids or destructive behavior.
